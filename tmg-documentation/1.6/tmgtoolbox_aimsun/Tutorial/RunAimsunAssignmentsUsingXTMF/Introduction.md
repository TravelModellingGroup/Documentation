# Aimsun Frabitztown Tutorial

## Introduction

This tutorial uses a small city called Frabitztown to create, setup and 
run a simulation using the Aimsun Tools. 

The tutorial is broken into the following five sections 
* **Create New Project Model System:** In the first section we create a 
new project and model system called FrabitstownTutorial. At the end of the first tutorial
we import the first Basic Travel Demand Model Template to have our base
network setup and initialized
* **To Execute:** In the second section we import and add the 
AimsunModeller Controller that is required to run the Aimsun software. 
We also will provide three path locations. First we provide the location to
the Aimsun path where the aconosole.exe resides. The second path location
provided is the location where the compressed Frabitztown network project
file is located. Note that the network project file is a compressed file 
in a .nwp format. The third path location is the location where the Aimsun
tools are located and stored on the device. 
* **Tools:** In the third section we import all the Aimsun tools that are 
currently available and go through the input parameters the user must input 
and provide. 
* **Save Project** In the fourth section we give a name to where our final
network is to be saved too. Note that we save the network using an .ang 
format which is the default format to open and read Aimsun network files.  
* **Run:** In the fifth and final section, we show how to run the simulation
* using the XTMF gui and how to find the location of the files and where they 
* reside.
