# Aimsun Frabitztown Tutorial

## Introduction

In this tutorial we will use a small city called Frabitztown to setup 
a connection from XTMF to run Aimsun and execute macro assignments.


The tutorial is broken into the following five sections 
* **[Create New Project Model System](CreateNewProjectandModelSystem.md):** In the first section we create a 
new project and model system called FrabitstownTutorial.
* **[To Execute](ToExecute.md):** In the second section we import and add the 
AimsunModeller Controller that is required to run the Aimsun software. 
* **[Tools](Tools.md):** In the third section we import and setup all the Aimsun tools that are 
available. 
* **[Save Project](SaveProject.md):** In the fourth section we give a name to where our final
network is to be saved too as an .ang format.  
* **[Run](Run.md):** In the fifth and final section, we run the simulation 
* using the XTMF Gui.
