# PopSynIII

## Overview

This population synthesis procedure used for GTAModel V4.1 and models derived from it.  It is recommended to setup this software on a virtual machine that can be isolated
from the internet and which has the sole purpose of running PopSynIII as the dependencies used are out of date and not secure.  Currently it is recommended that TMG executes
all PopSynIII runs for its member agencies.  This documentation is intended to be internal to TMG but made available externally for advanced users.

To facilitate the execution of PopSynIII TMG has developed a GUI to generate control files and post-process the results in [this Github Repository](https://github.com/TravelModellingGroup/PopSynIIIAutomated).

Even following all of these steps PopSynIII will sometimes randomly crash.  Make sure to check in on the results and if it fails try to run it again.

## Operation

You can follow the instructions [here](Setup.md) to learn how to setup all of PopSynIII's dependencies.

Once everything is setup you can review the input directory [here](InputDirectory.md) and follow the instructions for forecasting [here](Forecasting.md).
