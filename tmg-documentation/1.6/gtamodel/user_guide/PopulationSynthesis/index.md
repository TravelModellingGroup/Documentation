# Population Synthesis

There are multiple population synthesis algorithms used by TMG.

The three main ones are 
[V4.0 Population Synthesis](V4.0PopulationSynthesis/index.md),
[PopsynIII](PopSynIII/index.md), and [MetroPop](MetroPop/index.md).
These algorithms are used by GTAModel versions 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2 respectively.
