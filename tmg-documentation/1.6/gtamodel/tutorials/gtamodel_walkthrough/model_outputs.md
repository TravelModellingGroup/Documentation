1. Assigned Networks - Network Packages (NWP) files for each time period containing the final assigned road and transit scenarios.
1. Demand - For each time period a set of [MTX](../../user_guide/file_formats/emme_binary_matrix.md) matrices
1. LOS Matrices - For each time period a set of [MTX](../../user_guide/file_formats/emme_binary_matrix.md) matrices
1. [Microsimulation Results](../../user_guide/file_formats/microsim.md) - A set of CSV files that give the low level details from TASHA
    for Households, Persons, Trips, Mode Choice, Station Choice, and linkedages between driver and passenger.
1. Screenlines
1. StationAccess - For each time period and station the number of people using the station and the total capacity of the drive access station.
