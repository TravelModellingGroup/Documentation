# EMME Scripting - Overview

This tutorial will walk you through learning launching a programming environment within EMME, learning basic python,
EMME's class structure, scripting a simple algorithm editing a network, and finally converting that scripting into
an EMME Tool.  This tutorial is designed to work with both EMME 4's which use Python 2.X (EMME 4.0-EMME 4.4.5.1)
and Python 3 (EMME 4.6.0+).

If you already have an understanding of Python and EMME you might prefer the [How to write Emme tools](../../1.6/tmgtoolbox/how_to_write_emme_tool.md) tutorial.
That tutorial will walk you directly into creating a custom tool with example code.

## Steps

1. [Launching Jupyter Notebook From EMME](LaunchingNotebook.md)
1. [Basic Python](BasicPython.md)
1. [EMME Class Structure](EMMEClassStructure.md)
1. [Writing a Script](WritingAScript.md)
1. [Convert Script to Tool](ConvertScriptToTool.md)

## Conclusion

By the end of this tutorial you will have a basic understanding of the Python programming language, how EMME's classes interrelate,
have created an EMME script and converted that script into a new EMME tool available in a toolbox.
