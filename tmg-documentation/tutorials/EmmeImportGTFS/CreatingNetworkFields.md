# Creating Network Fields

As part of importing GTFS data in EMME we are required to create new network fields, see below:

## Steps
1.	Data Management > Network > Network field
2.	Route name - transit line, string, #route_name, Route Name
3.	Trip ID - transit line, string, #trip_id, Trip ID
4.	Stop Name - transit segment, string, #stop_name, Stop Name

## Next Steps

The next step is to rename our route names and transit lines according to our network coding standard.
