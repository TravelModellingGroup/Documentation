<h1 id="whats-new-in-xtmf-version-14">What's new in XTMF Version 1.4?</h1>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>
<p>As always, new iterations of XTMF address bugs previously identified in any of the issues created on the Github project tracker, and others
we may find internally.</p>
<h3 id="updated-gui">Updated GUI</h3>
<p>XTMF 1.4 now uses a more modern layout. Although 1.3 introduced a new look and feel, 1.4 further improves on that by using
material design by Google which is more familiar to a much larger percentage of users. Earlier versions of XTMF included a
standard File menu for application actions. This has been removed and replaced with a &quot;global&quot; window menu which attempts to behave
more similarly to native Windows applications. The menu has been placed in a sidebar which can be called from any section or tab of
the XTMF.Gui application.</p>
<p>Theming has also been substantially improved. Palette and light/dark settings are provided by the Material theme and XTMF no longer uses
the previous colour palettes (forest green, etc).</p>
<h3 id="unified-runs-under-the-scheduler-window">Unified Runs Under the Scheduler Window</h3>
<p>Model system runs will now appear under the same window: the Scheduler window. The scheduler window introduces two run lists &quot;active&quot; and &quot;finished&quot;,
which provides a useful overview of all past, present (and future) runs that have been initiated by the XTMF client.</p>
<h3 id="run-queuing">Run Queuing</h3>
<p>Model system runs can now be queued. XTMF 1.4 introduces the ability to both schedule and queue model system runs. A user can choose to have runs
execute simultaneously. This feature allows the user to postpone the starting of a model system run to a later date in time when there will be more
computing resources available, without having to actively be present at their workstation.</p>
<h3 id="system-and-in-app-notifications">System and In-App Notifications</h3>
<p>Several quality-of-life notifications systems has been added to XTMF. No matter which tab or window you are interacting with in XTMF, finished model system runs
will now display an in-app toast to notify if you have any errors (or success) messages that have occurred during an executing model system. In addition
to in-app toast messages, notification messages are also sent to the System tray, and will be collated by Windows for review for a later time if the user is
not currently at the workstation.</p>
<h2 id="requesting-new-features">Requesting New Features</h2>
<p>New feature requests are always welcome for the XTMF project. If you would like to contribute, make any suggestions for a new feature, or report any
bugs encountered during your usage of XTMF please see: <a href="https://github.com/TravelModellingGroup/XTMF/issues">https://github.com/TravelModellingGroup/XTMF/issues</a>.</p>
